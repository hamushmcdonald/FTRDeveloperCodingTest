1. You have a new requirement to implement for your application: its logic should stay
exactly the same but it will need to have a different user interface (e.g. if you wrote a
web app, a different UI may be a REPL). Please describe how you would go about implementing 
this new UI in your application? Would you need to restructure your solution in any way?

In order to deploy the CLI program NumberFrequencies as a web app my solution will need to be 
restructred in many ways. Firstly a form element will need to be used to recieve user input, it
will be controlled in the main() function of my application. Rather than printing output to the
console, text output will be printed to the web page, each call to console.log() will be replaced
with a call to edit the html body. Finally the logic surrounding halt, resume and quit in the 
existing application will be replaced by button elements in the web app.

2. You now need to make your application “production ready”, and deploy it so that it can
be used by customers. Please describe the steps you’d need to take for this to happen.

In order to make the application production ready I would deploy it as a ASP.NET Core Web App 
(Model-View-Controller) using AWS Amplify as this is currently the stack I am learning how to use 
for a personal project.

3. What did you think about this coding test - is there anything you’d suggest in order to
improve it?

Overall I enjoyed this coding test quite a bit. It was my first time using Typescript but I picked it up relatively
easily as it shares many similarites with languages I have previously used. The test definitely illustrated to me 
that I need more practice with node. I would guess that I could have completed the test in half the time with better 
knowledge of node.
